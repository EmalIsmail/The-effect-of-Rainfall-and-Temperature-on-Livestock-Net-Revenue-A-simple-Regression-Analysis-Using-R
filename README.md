# The-effect-of-Rainfall-and-Temperature-on-Livestock-Net-Revenue-A-simple-Regression-Analysis-Using-R

Based on the in-dept regression analysis of our dependent and independent
variables in discussion section the results can be summarized in the following
points. hence, in correlation co-e cient calculation of Livestock Net Income
with Temperature as well as Rainfall show that Livestock Net Income has
a negative relationship of -1.1 percent with Temperature and positive 2.38
percent correlation with Rainfall. Since, positive correlation exists when one
variable decreases as the other variable decreases, or one variable increases
while the other increases. Therefore, we can conclude that if rainfall rate
increases the Livestock Net Income will increase as well. Hence, if the the
rainfall amount decreases the Livestock Net Income of farmers will decrease.
Subsequently, since, inverse correlation or negative correlation describes
the relationship between two variables which change in opposing directions.
Based on that we can conclude that Increase in Temperature will force the
Livestock Net Income to decrease and the other way around.
Additionally, the aforementioned results in-dept analysis has been done
in discussion and results section of this paper along with tables and visual
representation of linear regression analysis as well as estimated equations.

Methodology
In this paper we are analyzing The e ect of rainfall and temperature on Live-
stock Net Revenue. Furthermore, for in-dept analysis we have used regression
to explain above-mentioned variables correlations and relationships or e ects
on each other. it is worth mentioning, that Regression analysis is a powerful
statistical method that allow us to examine the relationship between two or
more variables of interest.
